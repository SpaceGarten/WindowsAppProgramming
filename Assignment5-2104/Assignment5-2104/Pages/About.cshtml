    <p>The Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, developed by Hugh Everett, posits that every quantum event results in a branching of the universe into multiple parallel realities. This concept challenges the traditional Copenhagen interpretation.</p>

    <p>While the Many-Worlds Interpretation is still debated, some researchers have found evidence for it through experiments like the delayed-choice quantum eraser and quantum interference. These experiments suggest that the wavefunction of a quantum system describes all possible outcomes.</p>

    <p>The Many-Worlds Interpretation posits that every quantum event results in the universe branching into multiple parallel realities. In this view, the wavefunction doesn't collapse as it does in the Copenhagen interpretation, which is one of the key differences.\n Some researchers argue that this approach provides a simpler and more elegant explanation of quantum phenomena.</p>
